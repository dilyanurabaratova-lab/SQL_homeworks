(3, 'q5',20);

SELECT ID, Item, Vals
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ID ORDER BY Vals DESC) AS rnk
    FROM TestMaximum
) t
WHERE rnk = 1;
--Puzzle 5: In this puzzle you have to first find the maximum value for each Id and DetailedNumber, and then Sum the data using Id only. Please check out sample input and expected output.

CREATE TABLE SumOfMax (
    DetailedNumber INT,
    Vals INT,
    Id INT
);
INSERT INTO SumOfMax VALUES
(1,5,101), (1,4,101), (2,6,101), (2,3,101),
(3,3,102), (4,2,102), (4,3,102);

SELECT Id, SUM(MaxVals) AS SumOfMaxVals
FROM (
    SELECT Id, DetailedNumber, MAX(Vals) AS MaxVals
    FROM SumOfMax
    GROUP BY Id, DetailedNumber
) AS sub
GROUP BY Id;


--Puzzle 6: In this puzzle you have to find difference between a and b column between each row and if the difference is not equal to 0 then show the difference i.e. a â€“ b otherwise 0. Now you need to replace this zero with blank.Please check the sample input and the expected output.

CREATE TABLE TheZeroPuzzle (
    Id INT,
    a INT,
    b INT

SELECT 
    Id,
    a,
    b,
